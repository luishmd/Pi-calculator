# Description
Small script illustrating the application of a Monte Carlo method to determine the value of *Pi*.
	
	
# Technologies used
Python3

# Status
This work is completed.


# How it works
The idea is to generate randomly *N* points in a square. Then count the *C* number of points that fall inside the circle contained in the square (circle with the same diameter as the square).

An approximation of Pi is then given by 4*C/N.


# How to use it
1. Open *pi_calulator* and edit the parameter *N*
